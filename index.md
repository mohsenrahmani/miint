# Welcome to mint

mint is Mohsen's personal story in navigating the worlds of ML and data science. Coming from a STEM background, I plan to learn and share his learnings through this blog. Comments are always welcome.

## What am I up to

Being new to the world of ML, I'm familiarizing myself with the fundamentals by reading [the Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org) textbook. I am also experimenting with **GitHub** and **Kaggle**, hoping to start working on my first project soon.
