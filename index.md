# Welcome to mint

mint is Mohsen's personal story in navigating the worlds of ML and data science. I plan to learn and share my learning through this blog. Comments are always welcome.

## What am I up to

### Reading 

Being new to the world of ML, I'm familiarizing myself with the fundamentals by reading select sections of [the Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org), [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282), and [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880) books. I also look up things that I need more elaboration on and read blogposts on them.

### Doing

I am experimenting with **GitHub** and **Kaggle**. On Kaggle, I have started to write kernels for some of the past competitions and submit them. I find useful stuff in the notebooks submitted for the same competitions by other users.
